The purpose of this app is to be a social platform for GOT enthusists. 

Users are able to Post content and comment on peoples posts describing their thoughts/ opinions of the said post. 

This app was built using the following technologies for the back-end:     

    "body-parser": "^1.18.2",
    "chai": "^4.1.2",
    "chai-http": "^3.0.0",
    "express": "^4.16.2",
    "faker": "^4.1.0",
    "mocha": "^4.0.1",
    "mongo": "^0.1.0",
    "mongoose": "^4.13.6",
    "morgan": "^1.9.0",
    "nodemon": "^1.12.5",
    "path": "^0.12.7",
    "travis": "^0.1.1",
    "travis-cli": "^1.0.9"

We used jquery, html, javascript, and CSS for the front end.

Version 1 features include:

    Our REST API with given endpoints which allow a user to add content including new posts and comments of posts. 

    We built a feature to the UI so when viewing the POSTS they are sorted in order for the most recent content to be at the top of the page.
    The Comments section on each post is dynamic to count the number of comments each individual post has. 

Version 2 features we would like to include:

    Authentication for users to be able to sign up and login in. This will allo the app to identify the author by the user who logs in.

Version 3 features we would like to include:

    Post Categories. We would like to include a list of preset categories in which one can search for what they are looking for specifically and submit their posts to the appropriate category they are looking to talk about
